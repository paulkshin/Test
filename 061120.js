// Using bracket notation, we have now reset the item at index 1 from "b", to "not b anymore".

// In order to complete this challenge, set the 2nd position (index 1) of myArray to anything you want, besides "b".

let myArray = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];
// Only change code below this line
myArray[1] = "not b anymore";
// Only change code above this line
